hpss-http-proxy
===============


A small binary exposing the hpss client api over http.
This binary is authenticates itself towards HPSS by means
of a kerberos or unix keytab on startup.
Thereafter all access is done using this set of credentials.
Authentication via http is not supported (and probably will never be)

Type hpss-http-proxy -h for help.


to access it from a telnet session do :

GET /?action=ls&depth=1&flags=&newer=-1&older=-1 HTTP/1.1

where / is the path you want to look at.

See the python-hpss_proxy for a higher-level layer using this 
http-interface to hpss.
